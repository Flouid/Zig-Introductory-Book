# Overview
These projects are provided by the book [Introduction to Zig](https://pedropark99.github.io/zig-book/) by Pedro Park. My implementations are based on those provided, but I have modified and improved them to suit my own sensibilities. Specifically, add formal testing and reduce the usage of OOP concepts where I thought they didn't really make sense. In some cases, I have also added performance improvements. This is just a small repository to showcase my learning process for Zig.
